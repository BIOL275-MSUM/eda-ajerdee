## Abstract

Covid-19, also known as a newlt discovered coronavirus, is an infectious disease that is expressed through moderate respiratory illness spreading by droplets of salvia or discahrge from the nose. Indivudals with a higher risk to contracting Covid-19 include people with pre-existing conditions such as, cardiovasular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer, but not limited to just this group. I am curious to know the population to death ratio of the different races and ethnicities due to Covid-19. The dataset that will be used to explore this question is "The Covid Tracking Project" from The Atlantic. I will compare the population of each ethnicity per state with the amount of deaths in each population using exploratory data analysis.



## Introduction



## Methods


### Data Acquisitaion

The data was obtained from The Covid Tracking Project at https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard (“Racial Data Dashboard.” 2021). To obtain spreadsheet, click CSV link in the third paragraph of  the top section of the page to download the data. After obtaining the data, I used the read_csv function from the tidyverse package (R Core Team 2019) to upload the data into Rstudio. 

### Data Preperation

For the data analysis, I used Rstudio version 1.3.1093 (R Core Team 2020) and R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2020) for wrangling and data analysis. The data obtained was displayed in table1 which displayed the summary of data collected from all the states. I then used the summarize function from the tidyverse package (R Core Team 2019) to group by state, recorded number of cases, and recorded number of deaths.
